# Tipico Careers Job Listings â€“ QA Automation Project

## Project Description

This project is a QA automation suite for validating the job listings page at [Tipico Careers](https://www.tipico-careers.com/en/jobs/). It covers the following user scenario:

> **As a user, I want to see all the job openings under https://www.tipico-careers.com/en/jobs/ and be able to filter them by country and add/remove them to/from my favourites. Team name, position name and location should be present for each job and no more than 20 jobs should be listed per page.**

### Automated Test Scenarios

The following scenarios are implemented using Cucumber and Playwright:

- **Job Card Fields:** Each job card displays the team name, position name, and location.
- **Pagination:** No more than 20 jobs are listed per page.
- **Filtering:** Jobs can be filtered by country (e.g., Germany).
- **Favourites:** Jobs can be added to and removed from favourites, with UI feedback.
